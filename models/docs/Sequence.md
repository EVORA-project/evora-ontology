    - In cases where no reference sequence exists in public repositories, the corresponding
      FASTA sequence is expected; otherwise, the reference sequence is sufficient.
      In FASTA format the line before the nucleotide sequence, called the FASTA definition
      line, must begin with a charater ('>'), followed by a unique SeqID (sequence
      identifier). In case the sequence is made of multiple parts several fasta sequences
