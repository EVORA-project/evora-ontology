    - 'The title of the item should be as short and descriptive as possible. E.g.
      for virus products it should basically be based on the following Pattern:

      ''Virus name'', ''virus host type'', ''collection year'', ''country of collection''
      ex ''suspected epidemiological origin'', ''genotype'', ''strain'', ''variant
      name or specific feature'

    - The lowest weighted Data providers are triggered first, this may be usefull
