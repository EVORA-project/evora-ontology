# Slot: type of functional Characterization (typeOfFunctionalCharacterization) 


_Refers to the classification of a protein based on the specific type of functional analysis performed to determine its biological activities and roles. Possible values include 'Enzymatic' (the protein has been characterized for its enzyme activity) and 'Antigenic' (the protein has been characterized for its ability to elicit an immune response)._
