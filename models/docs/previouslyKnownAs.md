title: previously known as
deprecated: EVORAO:previouslyKnownAs is deprecated in favor of alternateName. The
  property required complementary information linked to a Taxon, which limited its
  applicability. alternateName provides broader support for historical and non-historical
  alternative names without requiring taxonomic context
