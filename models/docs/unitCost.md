## Properties

* Range: [Decimal](Decimal.md)

* Recommended: True





## Comments

* The cost per access may not always be defined as a fixed numerical value. In some cases, the price is conditional or available only upon request. To accommodate such cases, descriptive information should be provided through the property EVORAO:unitCostNote (xsd:string). This allows handling of cost statements such as “on request,” “depends on volume,” or “free access for academics,” which cannot be captured by a simple numeric value.
