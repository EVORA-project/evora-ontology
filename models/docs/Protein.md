      such cases, descriptive information should be provided through the property
      EVORAO:unitCostNote (xsd:string). This allows handling of cost statements such
      as “on request,” “depends on volume,” or “free access for academics,” which
      cannot be captured by a simple numeric value.

    - 'The pathogen identification contains information about name and taxon but in
      some cases(e.g: FAIRSHARING) there may have no direct pathogen related but simply
      a taxonomic information .... the default value should be the root of virology:
