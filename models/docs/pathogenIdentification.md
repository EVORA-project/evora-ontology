## Properties

* Range: [PathogenIdentification](PathogenIdentification.md)

* Multivalued: True

* Required: True





## Comments

* The pathogen identification contains information about name and taxon but in some cases(e.g: FAIRSHARING) there may have no direct pathogen related but simply a taxonomic information .... the default value should be the root of virology: Viruses
