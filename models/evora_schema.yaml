description: The EVORA Ontology harmonizes metadata in virology to describe viral
  resources, their derived products, and services. It aligns with FAIR principles
  to ensure interoperability, accessibility, and reusability across various projects.
  The EVORA Ontology aims to support preparedness and response to pandemics.
