name: EVORAO
description: The EVORAO Ontology provides a structured and harmonized vocabulary for
  describing shareable pathogens as characterized biological materials, along with
  their derived products and associated services, organized into collections. Developed
  within the EVORA project, it supports consistent metadata annotation across research
  infrastructures, promoting findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability
  (FAIR). By aligning with relevant standards and ontologies, EVORAO facilitates cross-domain
  collaboration, integration, and sharing of pathogenic resources and services to
  enhance pandemic preparedness and response. While initially focused on virology,
  EVORAO is designed to be extensible and also supports metadata harmonization for
  other pathogens. EVORAO is compatible with DCAT, making it well-suited for efficiently
  cataloguing pathogen collections and related resources.

- EVORAO is an ontology for standardized metadata supporting the sharing of pathogens
  as biological materials, their derived products, and associated services, organized
  into collections. While initially focused on virology, it is designed for interoperability
  and is extensible to other pathogens. EVORAO is compatible with DCAT, making it
  well-suited for efficiently cataloguing pathogen collections and related resources.

        - In cases where no reference sequence exists in public repositories, the
          corresponding FASTA sequence is expected; otherwise, the reference sequence
          is sufficient. In FASTA format the line before the nucleotide sequence,
          called the FASTA definition line, must begin with a charater ('>'), followed
          by a unique SeqID (sequence identifier). In case the sequence is made of
          multiple parts several fasta sequences can be provided
